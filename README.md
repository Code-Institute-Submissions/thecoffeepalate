## **Project Goal** 

Welcome to the Coffee Palate!

Aren't you tired of always having to choose between hunderds of differents coffees when you go to the supermarket? Do you always end up choosing that kind of coffee that barely meet your preferences just because there is not enough information about it? Have you ever realized how big roasters are always deciding which coffee you have to drink?
The Coffee Palate is finally here give you exactly what you are looking for in a cup of coffee! 

You can finally stop complying with what big roasting companies think you need and adjust the coffee profile to your own specific palate.
If every person is different, why do we have to drink the same kind of coffee, right? Coffee by convenience is no longer what you need. You deserve you own unique blend!
Throughout this website you can learn about different coffee origins, learn about the roasting profiles and, finally, based on your brand new acquired knowledge, develop your own exclusive blend. 
All of this, through an appealing, intuitive website with straight-forward and clear information.

Thank you for visiting my project and do not hesitate to contact me via GitHub if you have any doubts or concerns related to The Coffee Palate project.

### **Design Choices**
As a coffee roaster specialized in blends, I tried to choose colors, both cold and warm, that work harmoniously, standing out the same effect expected on a blend from different origins and coffee with different profiles.</p>
While trying to generate the business logo through [Tailor Brand](https://studio.tailorbrands.com/) I came across several appealing color schemes. Afterwards, I have transfered the most appealing one to [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) where, through slight adjustments, came up with a final, strong and harmounious scheme.

#### Fonts
Through [Tailor Brand](https://studio.tailorbrands.com/), I also got to know interesting font types. 

Afterwards, I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to try to replicate the ones found.

For the overall content I am using [Kumbh Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kumbh+Sans?preview.text=unique&preview.text_type=custom&sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Kumbh+Sans) font. A font that is easily readable and visually attractive.

For the headings I have decided to go with [Allerta Stencil](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Allerta+Stencil?preview.text=unique&preview.text_type=custom&sidebar.open=true&query=stencil) font, making the heading stand out from the general content and reflecting a characteristic from the roasting process: the cracks!

I trust that both typographies used blend very well with each other, creating a calm and inviting look to the website.

#### Icons
The icons that I will be using throughout my page are from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "FontAwesome").

The icons choosen are easy to understand and in line with the company branding , providing interest and supporting the navigation.

For instance, the navigation bar will collapse into a hambuger icon in mobile devices.

#### Colors

![Color Scheme](wireframes/tcp_color_scheme.png)


* congo-pink: #ed8074
The congo pink will be the color standing out the most as it will be used for the call-to-action buttons.

* metallic-seaweed: #1d7a8c;
The metallic-seaweed color will be and "aid" color. It will be used, if necesssary, to separate sections or highlight borders.

* outer-space-crayola: #0b3037;
This color will be the used throughout the website as the main text color. It has a great [contrast](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/0b3037-f8f8ff) with the background.

* ghost-white: #f8f8ff;

The overall website will have a clean and fresh background, reason why I have opted by the Ghost White.
This particular color has a blue-purple accent that eases the transition to the three colors already mentioned.

In the creation of this palette, the [Contrast-Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/0b3037-f8f8ff) tool from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors") has been used in order to guarantee as good user readability. 

#### Structure

My website will be divided into 3 different pages.

##### Landing Page
The landing page is aimed to be visually attractive, with appealing images/icons that says "Welcome" by itself, unconsciously engaging the reader and creating curiosity to keep navigating throughout the page.

##### The Lab
The Lab is the educational part of the website where readers can come to learn more about the different coffee origins available and the several roasting profiles provided by the company.

##### Blending Store
The Blending store is the place where the magic happens. Here, the consumer can put into practice his/her new-found knowledge and create their own unique blend.
